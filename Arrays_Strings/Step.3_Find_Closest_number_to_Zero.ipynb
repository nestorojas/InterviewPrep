    "# How the Algorithm Solves the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm aims to determine the number in the input array `nums` that is closest to zero. If there is a tie (i.e., two numbers with the same absolute distance to zero), the algorithm selects the larger number. Below is a detailed explanation of how the algorithm works step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Initialize Variables\n",
    "The algorithm initializes two variables:\n",
    "- `min_dist_to_zero`: This variable keeps track of the smallest absolute distance encountered so far.\n",
    "- `closest_to_zero_num`: This variable stores the number that is closest to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially:\n",
    "- `min_dist_to_zero` is set to `None` to signify that no distances have been evaluated yet.\n",
    "- `closest_to_zero_num` is set to `None` to signify that no closest number has been determined yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Traverse the Array\n",
    "The algorithm iterates through each number in the input array `nums` using a loop. For each number `num` in the array, the algorithm performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Calculate the Absolute Distance to Zero\n",
    "The algorithm computes the absolute distance of `num` to zero using the formula:"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### b. Compare the Current Distance with the Minimum Distance\n",
    "The algorithm compares the calculated distance `abs(num)` with the current `min_dist_to_zero`:\n",
    "1. **If `min_dist_to_zero` is `None`**:  \n",
    "   - This is the first number being processed.  \n",
    "   - Set `min_dist_to_zero = abs(num)` and `closest_to_zero_num = num`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **If `abs(num)` is less than `min_dist_to_zero`**:  \n",
    "   - Update `min_dist_to_zero = abs(num)` and `closest_to_zero_num = num`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If `abs(num)` is equal to `min_dist_to_zero`**:  \n",
    "   - In this case, there is a tie.  \n",
    "   - Compare `num` with the current `closest_to_zero_num`:\n",
    "     - If `num > closest_to_zero_num`, update `closest_to_zero_num = num`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. Move to the Next Number\n",
    "Continue processing the remaining numbers in the array until all numbers have been evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Return the Closest Number\n",
    "After completing the iteration through the array, the algorithm returns the value of `closest_to_zero_num`, which holds the number closest to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Algorithm Handles Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Single Element\n",
    "If the array contains only one number, that number is both the closest and the largest. The algorithm simply processes it as the only element and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Zeros\n",
    "If the array contains `0`, the absolute distance is `0`. Since no other number can have a smaller distance to zero, the algorithm always returns `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Ties\n",
    "If two numbers have the same absolute distance to zero (e.g., `1` and `-1`), the algorithm uses the `max()` function to select the larger value (e.g., `1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Large Input Size\n",
    "The algorithm processes each number in constant time `O(1)` per element, ensuring efficiency even for arrays with millions of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity: `O(n)`\n",
    "- The algorithm iterates through the array once, performing a constant amount of work for each number.  \n",
    "- Thus, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the array `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity: `O(1)`\n",
    "- The algorithm uses only a fixed amount of additional memory to store `min_dist_to_zero` and `closest_to_zero_num`.  \n",
    "- It does not require any extra space proportional to the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Key Features\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: The algorithm operates in linear time and constant space, making it suitable for large input sizes.\n",
    "- **Correctness**: The algorithm handles all edge cases, including ties and arrays containing zeros.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: By leveraging basic operations like `abs()` and comparisons, the algorithm avoids unnecessary complexity."
