## **Training Plan**

### **Week 1: Foundations & Full-Stack Development**  
- Refresh .NET Core, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MS SQL Server concepts.  
- Begin foundational Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA): Arrays, Strings, and Linked Lists.  

### **Week 2: Data Structures & Algorithms**  
- Sorting and searching algorithms.  
- Hash maps and hashing.  
- Trees and graphs.  
- Recursion and dynamic programming.  

### **Week 3: Advanced DSA & System Design**  
- Advanced graph algorithms (Dijkstraâ€™s, BFS/DFS).  
- Sliding window, two-pointer techniques.  
- Divide and conquer.  
- Mock coding interviews.  

### **Week 4: Behavioral, Mock Interviews, & Final Prep**  
- Coding problem practice.  
- System design mock interviews.  
- Behavioral questions using the STAR method.
